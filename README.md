## General Info

This project was requested as a rush delivery, due within one week, with the design already provided by the client. A colleague and I spent 5 days getting it pixel perfect and optimizing page speed to meet the client's high expectations.

## Challenges
The biggest challenge was creating a custom audio player and finding the best and fastest way to host a rather large podcast. We eventually decided to use SoundCloud's API despite its community's frustrations regarding SoundCloud's support and documentation.
